## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

source('./run_analysis.R')
download.data()
run.analysis()

Or run on terminal window
./run_analysis.R
[1] "Checks for data directory and creates one if it doesn't exist"
 [1] "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"           "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"          
 [3] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"           "tBodyAcc-std()-X"           
 [5] "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"            "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"           
 [7] "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"        "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"       
 [9] "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"        "tGravityAcc-std()-X"        


#Result dataset
tidydata.txt

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">


# Loading the data
# Read all the data into R
# Merge the data
# Extract Mean and SD and rename lable
# Tidy dataset
# Write into tidydata.txt
